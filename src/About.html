                        The Van Heusen story began in 1881 in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. Moses Phillips and his son,
                        Isaac, began selling shirts which were hand-sewn by Moses' wife, Endel, and their daughters to
                        the local coal miners. Quickly successful, Phillips expanded the operation to New York City.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Almost 30 years on, in 1919, Dutch immigrant John Manning Van Heusen was granted a patent for a
                        new process he created that fused cloth on a curve, creating a comfortable soft-folding collar
                        that retained the stiff-collar look of the era.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In New York, Van Heusen met with Isaac Phillips, who bought the U.S. patent for Van Heusen's
                        revolutionary soft-folding collar , and the Phillips-Van Heusen (PVH) alliance was born.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Today, while mastering the balance of Classic and Modern, Van Heusen establishes itself as a
                        Heritage Brand that is trusted to provide COMFORT AND INNOVATION TO EVERYDAY ESSENTIALS.
